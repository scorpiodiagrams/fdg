## Acknowledgments
We thank the people who helped us develop this material, and especially the students who have over the years worked through the material with us. In particular, Mark Tobenkin, William Throwe, Leo Stein, Peter Iannucci, and Micah Brodsky have suffered through bad explanations and have contributed better ones.

Edmund Bertschinger, Norman Margolus, Tom Knight, Rebecca Frankel, Alexey Radul, Edwin Taylor, Joel Moses, Kenneth Yip, and Hal Abelson helped us with many thoughtful discussions and advice about physics and its relation to mathematics.

We also thank Chris Hanson, Taylor Campbell, and the community of Scheme programmers for providing support and advice for the elegant language that we use. In particular, Gerald Jay Sussman wants to thank Guy Lewis Steele and Alexey Radul for many fun days of programming together—we learned much from each other’s style.
Matthew Halfant started us on the development of the Scmutils system. He encouraged us to get into scientific computation, using Scheme and functional style as an active way to explain the ideas, without the distractions of imperative languages such as C. In the 1980s he wrote some of the early Scheme procedures for numerical computation that we still use.

Dan Zuras helped us with the invention of the unique organization of the Scmutils system. It is because of his insight that the system is organized around a generic extension of the chain rule for taking derivatives. He also helped in the heavy lifting that was required to make a really good polynomial GCD algorithm, based on ideas we learned from Richard Zippel.

A special contribution that cannot be sufficiently acknowledged is from Seymour Papert and Marvin Minsky, who taught us that

the practice of programming is a powerful way to develop a deeper understanding of any subject. Indeed, by the act of debugging we learn about our misconceptions, and by reflecting on our bugs and their resolutions we learn ways to learn more effectively. Indeed, Turtle Geometry [2], a beautiful book about discrete differential geometry at a more elementary level, was inspired by Papert’s work on education. [13]

We acknowledge the generous support of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The laboratory provides a stimulating environment for efforts to formalize knowledge with computational methods. We also acknowledge the Panasonic Corporation (formerly the Matsushita Electric Industrial Corporation) for support of Gerald Jay Sussman through an endowed chair.

Jack Wisdom thanks his wife, Cecile, for her love and support. Julie Sussman, PPA, provided careful reading and serious criticism that inspired us to reorganize and rewrite major parts of the text. She has also developed and maintained Gerald Jay Sussman over these many years.
